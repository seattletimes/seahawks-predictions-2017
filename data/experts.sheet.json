    "comment": "A healthier Seahawks team should have another good run it especially with a schedule that shapes up as one of the more forgiving in the NFL this year and in the team's recent history. Seattle should be able to fend off Arizona to win a second straight division title and fourth in the last five years, and earn a bye in the first weekend of the playoffs. All of that assumes the offensive line improves just enough for Russell Wilson to stay healthier and that the defense avoids some of the significant injuries it suffered a year ago.",

That’s been a route to the Super Bowl in the past and I think it will be again this year. But the lame-duck Raiders will give their Oakland fans one more title to savor.",

The Seahawks are still one of, if not the most talented defensive teams in the NFL, and have enough on both sides of the ball to put together another double-digit win season. But their shortcomings on the offensive line will hamper their trademark running game and ultimately stifle them in the playoffs.",
